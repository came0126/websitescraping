# Data Scraper and Visualization
Developed a website scraping tool in Python that parses the top 500 websites from a CSV file.

The program keeps track of the number of links, number of images, number of meta tags, and the average length of each meta name tag. The data collection process is summarized and exported to a CSV. The data was imported into Plotly where graphs and diagrams were created to run data analysis.

The analysis folder contains the graphs and plots of the output.
